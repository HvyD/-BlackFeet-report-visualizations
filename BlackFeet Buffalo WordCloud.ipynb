The      “Lords of    the      Plains”    was    the         nickname given     to     the     Blackfeet  Nation because of       how        powerful they    were    in     the   Great    Plains, but    in     their  native language,  they      were      known    as      Sikikawa.

From        having   conflicts with   their   neighbors, the    Cree    Indians, the        tribe    decided to      move   west  to       the     Great  Plains in     the    early      1600s.
